# 🔒 SECURITY POLICY
### KTÜ SOFTWARE ENGINEERING // COUNTER-INTEL & PROTECTION

This document outlines the security protocols for the Karadeniz Teknik Üniversitesi Yazılım Mühendisliği repository.

---

## 🛡️ CORE PROTOCOLS

### 1. Data Integrity
All documents and Drive assets are periodically verified for integrity. Any unauthorized modification of internal CODEX files will result in immediate revocation of contribution rights.

### 2. Access Control
Access to external Google Drive assets is granted manually by the repository administrators. We do not use automated, unverified access tokens to prevent mass data extraction.

### 3. Vulnerability Reporting
If you identify a security flaw in our automation (GitHub Actions) or a data leak in our public documentation, please report it immediately:
*   **Security Command:** `yyilmazrabiaa@gmail.com`
*   **Subject:** `SECURITY-PROTOCOL-ALERT`

---

## 🚫 PROHIBITED ACTIONS
*   Redistributing internal Drive assets without academic authorization.
*   Spamming access requests.
*   Injecting malicious scripts into documentation formats.
