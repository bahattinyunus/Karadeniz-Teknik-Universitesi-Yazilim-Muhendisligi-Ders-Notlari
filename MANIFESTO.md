# 📜 THE ENGINEERING MANIFESTO
### KTÜ SOFTWARE ENGINEERING // CODENAME: ASCENSION

Software Engineering is not just a profession; it is the art of architecting reality through logic and code. This manifesto outlines the core philosophies of this repository and the mindset required to ascend as a System Architect.

## 🏛️ CORE DOCTRINES

### 1. Logic Over Syntax
Tools and languages change, but logic is eternal. We prioritize understanding the underlying algorithms and data structures over memorizing keywords.

### 2. Architecture is destiny
A system is only as strong as its foundation. We advocate for clean code, solid design patterns, and scalable architectures from the very first line.

### 3. Continuous Evolution
The field of software engineering is in a state of perpetual expansion. To stay relevant, one must maintain a mindset of continuous research and adaptation.

### 4. Community Resillience
Collaboration is our greatest multiplier. We contribute to open source, share knowledge, and support our peers to strengthen the collective engineering ecosystem.
