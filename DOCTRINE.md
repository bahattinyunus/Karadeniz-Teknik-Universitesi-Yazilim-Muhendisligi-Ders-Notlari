# 📜 THE DOCTRINE OF EXCELLENCE
### KTÜ SE // QUANTUM CODING STANDARDS

This is NOT a guide. This is the law of this system. To survive and dominate in the Software Engineering field, you must internalize these ten commandments.

## 🏛️ THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

1.  **Optimization is Duty:** Never settle for a slow algorithm. O(n^2) is a crime if O(n log n) is possible.
2.  **Architecture is Sovereign:** Clean architecture is the only way to prevent entropy. Respect the SOLID principles as holy text.
3.  **Documentation is Legacy:** Code speaks, but documentation explains why. Leave a legacy that the next generation can build upon.
4.  **Security is Default:** A system without security is a house without a foundation. Encrypt, validate, and shield everything.
5.  **Refactor or Perish:** Technical debt is a slow poison. Constant refactoring is the antidote.
6.  **Test to the Death:** A single bug can collapse a singularity. Test every edge case, every failure mode.
7.  **Automation is Freedom:** If a task can be automated, it must be automated. Reclaim your biological processing time.
8.  **Knowledge is Fluid:** The tech stack you know today will be obsolete tomorrow. Stay liquid.
9.  **Peer Review is Shielding:** Your peers are your best defensive layer. Seek review, give review, improve the collective.
10. **The User is the Singularity:** Everything we build serves the human experience. Never lose sight of the objective.
